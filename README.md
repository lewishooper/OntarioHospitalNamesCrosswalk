Crosswalk of Ontario Hospital Names, 
Names used by the Hospital, the MOH, CIHI, the Sunshine List and others. There is a surprising variation in names, and they do change from time to time. 
This project will create a YAML list of names linked to the FAC, which is a unique identifier used by the MOH. It will also include the type of hospital as identified by the MOH and eventually by CIHI
It does include some common misspellings of the name, as this happens in the Sunshine List, where names are not well verified.
Phase 1 includes the MOH, the Sunshine List, the hospital type, and an indicator of risk in using the particular name. e.g. in some cases, a hospital may be referred to as "Community General" or "Hotel Dieu"
This could lead to misidentification and should be used with caution, as there are several hospitals that use Community General, and there is more than one Hotel Dieu in Ontario
Phase 2 will include incorporating CIHI names and types
